Let's fight against shit like this.


## Step 1. Locate misinformation
1. Searching for Tweets that spread misinformation about the war in Ukraine, or try to position Ukraine as the aggressor. [Here](https://twitter.com/search?q=(%23denazifyukraine%20OR%20%23freedontesk%20OR%20%23fightfascism%20OR%23freeluhansk%20OR%20%23denationalizeukraine%20OR%20%23demilitarizeukraine%20OR%20%23russiaisright)&src=typed_query&f=top) is a Twitter advanced search that combines some hashtags commonly used. 

Pro-tip: Use [Social Bearing](https://socialbearing.com/) to search for hashtags. You can also visualize number of tweets over time - here are tweets mentioning _"denazifyukraine"_ in the past few days:
